# <Horiseon Code Refactor> 

This Horiseon code refactor is to declutter css, make sure internal links work properly, 
make sure elements follow logical structure, make accessible alt attributes when viewing 
image elements, create a descriptive title for the title element, make the html easier to read, and make sure my heading 
attributes fall in sequential order.

* Create adequate spacing between html elements so they can be easily read
* In the heading, put "meta charset= utf-8" first, the title second, and the stylesheet link 3rd
* Update the first "div" in the body section to "nav" to represent the navigation menu.
*
